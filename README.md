Building AI systems that do what I want, the way I want them to.

## What I'm Building

### Festival Methodology
**AI-native project management that scales autonomous operations**

A goal-oriented framework that transforms high-level objectives into executable work AI agents can complete independently. Festival bridges the gap between what you want to build and what AI can actually execute—maintaining context, tracking decisions, and enabling agents to work autonomously for days instead of minutes.

**Key innovations:**
- **Hierarchical goal decomposition** – Festival/Phase/Sequence structure with measurable KPIs at every level
- **Context preservation** – Decisions and rationale maintained across sessions in CONTEXT.md
- **Autonomy levels** – Tasks marked High/Medium/Low so agents know when to proceed vs. ask for help
- **Quality gates** – Configurable evaluation frameworks ensure work meets standards before moving forward

**[fest CLI](https://github.com/lancekrogers/festival-methodology/tree/main/fest)** – Production-grade Go tool with:
- SHA256 checksums for file integrity
- Smart updates (only changed files)
- Backup support before operations
- Token counting for LLM cost estimation
- Config repos for templates/policies
- Extension system for custom commands
- Festival index generation for tool integration

### Agent Orchestration Infrastructure
**Breaking the linear constraint in AI tooling**

Collaborative configuration systems that enable nonlinear scaling of autonomous operations. Moving beyond single-agent, single-task paradigms to infrastructure where multiple agents coordinate on complex, multi-stage work.

---

### Claude Code Go SDK
**First unofficial SDK for Anthropic's Claude Code CLI (27⭐)**

Built in <1 week post-launch. Taught me that autonomous agents need fundamentally different infrastructure than human-driven workflows.

---

**Currently:** Deep in production agent systems. Building infrastructure for teams of 1000+ agents that actually work together.

**Focus:** Agent orchestration • Collaborative configuration • Autonomous execution at scale
