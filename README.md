### ðŸ§  About Me

I specialize in building and scaling **high-leverage systems** across backend engineering, blockchain architecture, and AI agent frameworks.

With 9+ years of experience spanning startups and enterprises, I bring a strategic mindset to technical execution â€” helping organizations modernize infrastructure, unlock new markets, improve team processes, and ship durable, scalable products.

- Consulted for clients including Bank of America, PNC, and Shutterfly on engineering modernization, system security, and process automation.
- Former technical cofounder of Swapblocks, a decentralized real-world asset protocol.
- Currently developing a modular AI agent framework and actively exploring new opportunities to architect durable, impactful systems.
- Developed the initial architecture and technical planning for ShinySwap, a decentralized peer-to-peer precious metals exchange.  
  The project was paused to prioritize client work and focus on building modular AI systems aimed at increasing personal and organizational leverage.
