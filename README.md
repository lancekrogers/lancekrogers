# Lance Rogers

Building AI systems that do what I want, the way I want them to.

## What I'm Building

**Festival Methodology** – AI-native project management framework. Hierarchical goals, autonomy levels, and context preservation that let AI agents work autonomously for days instead of minutes.

**Agent Orchestration Infrastructure** – Breaking the linear constraint in AI tooling. Collaborative configuration systems that enable nonlinear scaling of autonomous operations.

**Claude Code Go SDK** – First unofficial SDK for Anthropic's Claude Code CLI (27⭐). Built it in <1 week post-launch. Taught me that autonomous agents need fundamentally different infrastructure.

---

**Currently:** Deep in production agent systems. Building infrastructure for teams of 1000+ agents that actually work together.

**Focus:** Agent orchestration • Collaborative configuration • Autonomous execution at scale
